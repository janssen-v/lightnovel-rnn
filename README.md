# lightnovel-rnn
Generating Light Novel titles with a recurrent neural network
## Work in Progress
This is just a little side project for my amusement, so updates will be infrequent. Currently, the program does not check whether or not the generated titles already exist within the training dataset. The plan is to add some code to detect duplicates and remove them before they are output.

## How to run
### Locally
1. Clone the repository onto your desktop
2. Make sure tensorflow is installed (w/ CUDA support recommended)
3. Run lightnovel-rnn.py
4. Results will be output into results.txt
### On Google Colab
1. Copy the URL of this repository and open Colab
2. Go to the GitHub tab, paste the URL and open the repo
3. Run the notebook
4. Results will be printed on-screen
